# Coursera:  Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python

## Certificate: https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/DQ99M2WR99GK

This repository is mainly for projects I have done under a course of Coursera.

This course introduces the visualization basics, with a focus on reporting and charting using the matplotlib library. The course focuses on the technology used to make visualizations in python, matplotlib, and introduce users to best practices when creating basic charts and how to realize design decisions in the framework. There are also have a tutorial of functionality available in matplotlib, and demonstrate a variety of basic statistical charts helping learners to identify when a particular method is good for a particular problem. 

## Week 1: Principles of Information Visualization
Content: getting an introduction to principles of information visualization and some tools for thinking about design and graphical heuristics for thinking about creating effective visualizations

## Week 2: Basic Charting
Content: 
- working with real world CSV weather data and manipulating the data to display the minimum and maximum temperature for a range of dates and demonstrate and show that you know how to create a line graph using matplotlib.
- demonstrating the procedure of composite charts, by overlaying a scatter plot of record breaking data for a given year.

## Week 3: Charting Fundamentals
Content:  Implement a new visualization technique based on academic research. This assignment is flexible and you can address it using a variety of difficulties - from an easy static image to an interactive chart where users can set ranges of values to be used.

## Week 4: Applied Visualizations
Content: 
- Use at least two publicly accessible datasets from the same region that are consistent across a meaningful dimension. 
- State a research question that can be answered using these data sets and then create a visual using matplotlib that addresses your stated research question. 
- justify how your visual addresses your research question.
